# Intuition behind algorithm

zero <- function(input) {
  if (x) {
    buy
  } else if (y) {
    sell
  } else {
    do_nothing
  }
  
}



# Backtesting -------------------------------------------------------------

# The next step in creating the algorithm is to backtest it.
# To backtest, we need to run the algorithm (function) row by row
# to execute the hypothetical buys and sells.
